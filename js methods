In the context of web browsers and the Document Object Model (DOM), there are numerous methods available that can be used to interact with elements, manipulate the DOM, handle events, and perform various tasks. Here's a list of commonly used methods available in browsers when working with JavaScript:

Element Selection and Manipulation:
document.getElementById(): Selects an element by its ID.
document.getElementsByClassName(): Selects elements by class name.
document.getElementsByTagName(): Selects elements by tag name.
document.querySelector(): Selects the first element that matches a CSS selector.
document.querySelectorAll(): Selects all elements that match a CSS selector.
element.setAttribute(): Sets the value of an attribute on the specified element.
element.getAttribute(): Retrieves the value of a specified attribute on the element.
element.classList.add/remove/toggle/contains(): Manipulates the class list of an element.
element.style.property: Accesses or modifies inline CSS styles of an element.
  
DOM Manipulation:
document.createElement(): Creates a new HTML element.
element.appendChild(): Appends a child element to another element.
element.removeChild(): Removes a child element from its parent.
element.innerHTML: Accesses or sets the HTML content of an element.
element.innerText or element.textContent: Accesses or sets the text content of an element.
element.cloneNode(): Clones a node, optionally including its children.
  
Event Handling:
element.addEventListener(): Attaches an event listener to an element.
element.removeEventListener(): Removes an event listener from an element.
event.preventDefault(): Prevents the default behavior of an event.
event.stopPropagation(): Stops the event from propagating to parent elements.
event.target: References the element that triggered the event.
  
AJAX and Fetch:
XMLHttpRequest: Object used to make HTTP requests (older method).
fetch(): Modern API to make HTTP requests and handle responses.
  
Browser Interaction:
window.alert(), window.confirm(), window.prompt(): Displays alert boxes, confirmation dialogs, and prompts.
window.open(): Opens a new browser window or tab.
window.location: Accesses or sets information about the current URL.
These are just some of the methods available for interacting with the browser and manipulating the DOM using JavaScript. The actual usage of these methods varies based on the specific requirements and interactions within your web application.
